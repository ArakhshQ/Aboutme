- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Arakhsh Qanit, a junior web developer.
- ðŸ‘€ I got into coding about two years ago, and since then, I've learned a lot. I still want to discover new things in every programming language.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning PHP, JavaScript, and Python to create websites. I already know much about HTML and CSS. I created my first website from scratch, and it was amazing.
- I am a coding junior, so I have a lot to learn. But I am excited about it, and I would love to help others with their projects.
- Besides English, I can speak Persian (first language), Turkish, Urdu, and a little bit of German.
- I have a huge interest in Persian poetry and literature. I spend most of my time reading the works of great poets and mystics. I also love playing football and video games.
- I enjoy the simple and precious moments of life and don't worry too much about the uncertain things.
